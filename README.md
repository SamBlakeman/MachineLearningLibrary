# MachineLearningLibrary

Work in progress C++ library for basic machine learning techniques.

This is much a learning tool as anything else but feedback on improvements would be much appreciated.

The library uses the linear algebra library Eigen and has been compiled using XCode.

The test scripts folder contains files with basic examples of how to use the different models. The model interface has been loosely modelled on python's sci-kit learn.

There are also some pre-processing methods and some basic hand-written utility functions.

Please do comment and help make this project a genuinely useful tool!
