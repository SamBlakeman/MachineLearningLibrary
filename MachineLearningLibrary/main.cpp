     - Sort gradients for relu and linear in the hidden layer
     - Maybe also include a leaky relu
     - incorporate regression cost function and linear gradients at the outputs layer
     
     
     - Naive Bayes classifer
     - finish all the constructor combinations
     - make continuous and discrete an enum
     - allow for continuous input variables - needs testing
     - maybe have likelihoods calculated during fitting rather than predicting
     - accuracy, confusion matrix etc.
     - maybe also allow for strings
     
     - Neural Network - two layer implementation, forward propagation implemented
     - Improve transpose method
     - SVM
     - learning curve
     - validation curve
