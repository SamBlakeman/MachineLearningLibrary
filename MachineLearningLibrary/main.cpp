     TODO:
     
     Machine Learning Model Base Class:
     - validation curve
     - learning curve
     - other useful exploratory methods that are shared for all models
     - other subclasses?
     
     
     Logistic Regression:
     - Newtons Method --> unsure of how to calculate the Hessian
     
     
     Neural Networks:
     - Allow for several outputs for regression (sort out one hot encoding function)
     - Generative Pre-Training
     - Dropout
     - Weight decay
     - Softmax
     
     
     Naive Bayes classifer:
     - finish all the constructor combinations
     - make continuous and discrete an enum
     - allow for continuous input variables - needs testing
     - maybe have likelihoods calculated during fitting rather than predicting
     - accuracy, confusion matrix etc.
     - maybe also allow for strings
     
     
     Gaussian Discriminant Analysis:
     - Implement
     
     
     SVM:
     - check what y should be!! should it be -1 rather than 0?
     
     
     Decision Trees:
     - Implement
     
     
     AutoEncoder:
     - Implement
